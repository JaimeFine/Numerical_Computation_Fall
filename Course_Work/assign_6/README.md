# Assignment 6

Determine the parameters $a$ and $b$ in the empirical curve $y=a e^{bx}$ so that the curve fits the following data:

<div align="center">

| $x_i$ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|
| $y_i$ | 60 | 30 | 20 | 15 |

</div>

1. Write out the derivation process by hand, without providing the final result.
2. Write a program to compute the result and plot the fitted curve. Implement the core least-squares algorithm yourself—do not use built-in fitting library functions—but you may directly use existing library functions to solve linear systems or perform matrix operations.
