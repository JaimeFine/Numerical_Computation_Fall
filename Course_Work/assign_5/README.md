# Assignment 5

## Task 1
Given the values of the continuous function $f(x)$ at $x=−1,0,2,3$ are $−4,−1,0,3$ respectively, use Newton interpolation to find:

- An approximate value for $f(1.5)$;
- An approximate value for x when $f(x)=0.5$;
- Further add a point $(3.1,0.1)$ to the above four points, perform calculations manually, take a photo of your work and paste it here;
- Call the Newton interpolation function to implement interpolation and plot the graph;
- Use other interpolation functions (Lagrange method, Hermite, Spline interpolation, etc., mentioning at least several of these) for comparison. You do not need to write the comparison functions yourself.

## Task 2
For the function $R(x)=\frac{1}{1 + x^{2}}$, using equidistant nodes $x_{i}=-5 + i\ (i = 0,1,2,\cdots,10)$, provide the graph of its 10th-degree Newton interpolation polynomial. This can be directly implemented through programming without manual derivation.
